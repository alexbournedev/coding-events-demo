// Purpose: 

To mimic Meetup in spirit, and to show progress and knowledge in Java + MySQL.


// Current state: 

Can create/update/delete Events, as well as search by category (can also create/delete custom Event Category type, ie: "Social"). 
This app is also persistent on my local host (MySQL Workbench), so data is not lost upon closing the page.


// On the Horizon: 

Adding a "Person" class to allow user login functionality, as well as Authorization of those users and their credentials.
